# Associative Learning V2 - Audio Assets

This folder should contain 3 audio files for the test.

## Required Files:

1. `sound1.mp3` - Audio for symbol1 (first word in the sentence)
2. `sound2.mp3` - Audio for symbol2 (third word in the sentence)
3. `sound3.mp3` - Audio for symbol3 (second word in the sentence)

## Instructions:

1. Add your 3 MP3 audio files to this directory
2. Name them exactly as shown above (sound1.mp3, sound2.mp3, sound3.mp3)
3. Keep audio files short (1-3 seconds each)
4. Ensure audio quality is clear and at consistent volume levels
5. Format: MP3, recommended bitrate 128kbps or higher

## Notes:

- In the sentence building phase, the audio files will be played in sequence: sound1 → sound2 → sound3
- The correct symbol order for the sentence is: symbol1, symbol3, symbol2
- This means the sentence structure is: [word1, word2, word3] mapped to [symbol1, symbol3, symbol2]
- Example: If sounds are "the", "jumps", "dog", the sentence would be "the dog jumps" = symbol1, symbol3, symbol2
