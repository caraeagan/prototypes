# Associative Learning V2 - Video Assets

This folder is reserved for future video assets that may be used in the test.

## Currently Not Used

Video assets are not currently implemented in the Associative Learning V2 test, but this folder is prepared for future enhancements.

## Potential Future Uses:

- Instructional videos for students
- Animated symbol demonstrations
- Example scenarios or context videos

If you plan to add video functionality, supported formats include:
- MP4 (H.264 codec recommended)
- WebM
- OGG

Keep file sizes manageable (under 10MB per video if possible) for optimal loading times.
